            <AccordionTrigger>How does the QR code validation work?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Your digital pass includes a unique QR code that contains encrypted information about your pass. Bus
              conductors can scan this QR code using the BusBuddy verification app to validate your pass. The QR code
              changes periodically for security.

            <AccordionTrigger>Can I have multiple active passes at once?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              No, you can only have one active pass at a time. If you need to create a new pass with different routes or
              validity, you'll need to wait until your current pass expires.

            <AccordionContent>
              If your pass is not scanning properly, ensure your screen brightness is at maximum and the QR code is
              fully visible. If the issue persists, you can regenerate the QR code from the "View Pass" section or
              contact our support team for assistance.
